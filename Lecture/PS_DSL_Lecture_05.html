<h2>The Semantic Model and Symbol Table</h2>The term Semantic Model is
used over and over and over again in the book and throughout CS.
&nbsp;It seems to be one of &nbsp;those overloaded terms which is used
constantly but never really well defined at least well enough so
students feel they have a strong grasp of the term in it's various
contexts. &nbsp;So let's get it straight and tear it apart!<br><br>Definition of 'semantic' - is the study of meaning. &nbsp;It is the study of the relationship between <span style="font-style: italic;">signifiers</span>, such as words, phrases, symbols and signs,&nbsp;and what they stand for, their <span style="font-style: italic;">denotata</span>.<br><br>Definition of 'model':<br><ol><li>a standard or example for imitation or comparison.</li><li>a representation, generally in miniature, to show the construction or appearance of something.</li><li>an image in clay, wax, or the like, to be reproduced in more durable material.</li><li>etc, etc, etc....</li></ol>According to Eric Evans,
author of Domain Driven Design, the semantic model is the model of the
domain where you can apply all the principles that&nbsp;DDD espouses.
&nbsp;The linguistic abstraction is a thin veneer on top of the
underlying model. &nbsp;The more well abstracted your model is, the
easier the construction of the layer on top of it will be.<p>You must realize that the term 'semantic model'
can represent the abstract form Evan associates with the domain you are
trying to model and the concrete representation that Fowler often works
in when describing the development of DSLs. &nbsp;We will look at it
from Martin Fowler's perspective but we may move between the abstract
and the concrete during the discussion.</p><p>In the context of a DSL,
a semantic model is a representation, such as an in-memory object
model, of the same subject that the DSL describes. &nbsp;The semantic
model acts as a repository for the next action that you execute.
&nbsp;If the DSL describes a state machine, then the Semantic Model
might be an object model with classes for state, event, etc. &nbsp;The
Semantic Model is the library or framework that the DSL populates.</p><p>A
semantic model is a notion very similar to that of a Domain Model.
&nbsp;A Domain Model captures the core behavior of an application,
while a Semantic Model may play a supporting role. &nbsp;A good example
of this is an object-relational mapper that coordinates data between an
object model and a relational database. &nbsp;You could use a DSL to
describe object-relational mappings, and the resulting Semantic Model
would consist of the Data Mappers, not the Domain Model that is the
subject of the mapping.</p><p>A Semantic Model is usually different
from a Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) because they &nbsp;server separate
purposes. &nbsp;A syntax tree corresponds to the structure of the DSL
scripts. &nbsp;Although an AST may simplify and somewhat reorganize the
input data, it still takes fundamentally the same form. &nbsp;The
Semantic Model, however, is based on what will be done with the
information from a DSL script. &nbsp;It often will be substantially
different structure, and usually not a tree structure. &nbsp;There are
occasions when an AST is an effective Semantic Model for a DSL, but
these are the exception rather than the rule.</p>The Semantic Model can
often precede the DSL. &nbsp;This happens when you decide that a
portion of the Domain Model might be better populated from a DSL than
from a regular command-query interface. &nbsp;Alternatively, you can
build a DSL and Semantic Model together using the discussions with
Domain experts both to refine the expressions of the DSL and the
structure of the the Domain Model.<br><br>The Semantic Model can either
hold the code to execute itself (interpreter style), or be the basis
for code generation (compiler style). &nbsp;Even if you are using code
generation, it's useful to provide interpretation to help with testing
and debugging.<br><br>So let's build an Semantic Model for the fun of it...<br><br><h2>Tips on Building Models<br></h2><ol><li>Understand
the business completely. &nbsp;In my view this is the best part of our
job. &nbsp;I've working in manufacturing, insurance, finance, banking,
medical devices, medical records, pharmaceuticals, &nbsp;retail and
others.&nbsp;</li><li>Use good names for all your classes. &nbsp;If you
can't explain an object to someone then it's probably not right.
&nbsp;That's OK, get it right on the next iteration. &nbsp;Names should
be consistent and some stupid overloaded computer term, it should be
something the business understands implicitly. &nbsp;The name should be
exact in that it defines the responsibilities of the entity in the
model.</li><li>Use metaphors to model abstract operations/entities to
help simplify the design of the model. &nbsp;For example, "Sticky Note"
is a comment that hangs on to some entity as it travels through the
order process flow.</li><li>Make the model self-contained. &nbsp;It
should contain the raw logic of the application. &nbsp;Any additional
logic should be contained in some layers, as for instance the
work-flow, dependency injection, persistence....</li><li>The model
should be independent. &nbsp;The model shouldn't change because the
underlying persistence implementation or the UI or any other
&nbsp;layer changes.</li><li>The model should be technically simple.
&nbsp;It should only contain POJOs. &nbsp;The responsibilities assigned
to an entity in the model should be limited to only those necessary for
the software domain.</li><li>Keep the model up to date.</li><li>Make
sure the software model matches the business model. &nbsp;The software
domain should be easy to understand for the businessmodel expert and it shouldn't have any discrepancy. </li><li>Care
for the code quality of you model because it is the foundation of your
application. &nbsp;If it is bad the whole thing can fall apart, plus
changes are inevitable to your model so it has to be adaptable.</li><li>Test your model independently and involve your customer in testing.</li></ol><h2>Card Game Semantic Model</h2>Although
not as famous as its logical or physical data model cousins, the
semantic model deserves generally greater consideration because of its
unyielding focus on the user perspective. When built correctly, the
semantic model is the user's perspective of the data-and what could be
more important?<br><br>In a general sense, semantics is the study of
meanings-of the message behind the words. "Semantic" in the context of
data and applications means "from the user's perspective." It is the
data in context-where the meaning is. "Information" is also often
defined as "data in context." "Semantic" therefore, while not
synonymous with information, carries with it the same sense of data at
work, or data in the worker's hands. <br><br>Semantic data elements
are deceptively similar to the entities and attributes we find in a
logical or physical data model. They are things like "customer,"
"product," "credit limit," "net sales," and so forth. What the semantic
modeler must address however, is the context of the term-the data
element- and how it relates to the data elements as present in the
computing systems data stores. For example, is a customer an
individual-the Purchasing Agent- or a company? Must a customer have
actually purchased a product, or can a customer also be someone who is
in the market for a (the) product? What in some contexts might be
called a "prospect" might be called a "customer" in others. Is a
customer a wholesaler or is the end consumer the customer? Is the
wholesaler's customer also called a customer?<br><br>The answer to
these questions is likely to be "it depends." And that is the correct
answer, because it does depend. It depends on who is asking and why.
ABC company's sales department may draw a clear line between customers
(buyers) and prospects. ABC's marketing department may simply use
"customer" to refer to those participating in the market, whether or
not they've actually bought ABC's product.<br><br>The semantic modeler
must drill down and capture the nuance of each perspective and must
struggle to work with the business users to develop a naming convention
or syntax that provides clarity. All perspectives are represented in
the semantic model. <br><br>So in our example let's create a semantic model for working with cards and card games. &nbsp;Obvious terms include:<br><br><ul><li>Card</li><li>Suit</li><li>Deck</li><li>Player</li><li>Deal</li><li>Shuffle</li></ul>Ok,
sounds good, now what? &nbsp;We have to look at the relationships and
actions. &nbsp;For example, suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades)
pertain to cards. &nbsp;Deck is a collection of cards, while shuffle is
an action taken on a deck.<br><br><img style="width: 289px; height: 248px;" alt="Card Player Use Case Diagram" src="images/CardPlayerUseCase.jpg"><br><br><br><h3>Data Dictionary:</h3><br><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Term</td><td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Description</td><td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Type</td></tr><tr><td>Player</td><td>An external entity that will interact with other players and the deck of cards.</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Card</td><td>A data item that has value and suit.</td><td>Data</td></tr><tr><td>Hand</td><td>A collection of cards held by a player.</td><td>Collection</td></tr><tr><td>Deck</td><td>A collection of cards.</td><td>Collection</td></tr><tr><td>Shuffle</td><td>A player will manipulate the deck of cards to rearrange the order of the collection.</td><td>Use Case</td></tr><tr><td>Deal</td><td>A
