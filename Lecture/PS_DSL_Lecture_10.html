<h2>Patterns for Internal DSLs (Continued)<br>
</h2>

This is a continuation of Lecture 9 topics but now we move on to more
advanced (and critical) topics.<br>

<br>

The goal of this lecture is to demonstrate advanced patterns found in
DSLs.&nbsp; Some of these are:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Literal List<br>
  </li>
  <li>Literal Map<br>
  </li>
  <li>Closure</li>
  <li>Nested Closure<br>
  </li>
  <li>Dynamic Method Reception<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr><span style="font-weight: bold;">Literal List</span><br>

<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Represent language expression with a literal list.</span><br>
<br>
If you're thinking in Java this is an ArrayList type.&nbsp; However
Java lacks a literal form for an ArrayList (a Java array initializer is
similar but different).<br>
<br>
Example - Literal List of Strings (Groovy)<br>
<br>
def candidates = ["Romney", "Santorum","Gingrich","Paul"]<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How It Works</span><br>
<br>
A Literal List is a language construct for forming a list data structure.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">When To Use It</span><br>
<br>
You probably use ArrayList now.&nbsp; If you had Literal List in Java you would definitely use it.<br>

<br>

<hr><span style="font-weight: bold;">Literal Map</span><br>

<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Represent an expression as a literal map (key/value pairing).</span><br>
<br>
Example - Computer Configuration (Groovy)<br>
<br>
["computer": ["processor" : ["cores":2, "type":i386]], ["disk": ["size":150],"disk": ["size":75,"speed": 7200]]]<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How It Works</span><br>
<br>
A Literal Map is a language construct that allows you to form a map data structure (aka dictionary, hashmap, associative array).<br>
<br>
When To Use It<br>
<br>
Literal Map is great choice when you need a list of different elements
where each element should appear only once (the keys form a set and a
set does not allow duplicates).<br>
<br>

<br>

<hr><span style="font-weight: bold;">Closure</span><br>

<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">A block of code that&nbsp; can be
represented&nbsp; as an object&nbsp; (or first-class data&nbsp;
structure)&nbsp; and placed seamlessly&nbsp; into the flow&nbsp; of
code by&nbsp; allowing&nbsp; it to reference&nbsp; its lexical
scope.&nbsp; Also:&nbsp; lambda,&nbsp; or anonymous function.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

<br>

Example - Iterating Over Characters in
String<br>

<br>

Let's contrast this simple task programmed in Java versus programmed in
Groovy.&nbsp; First the Java code.&nbsp; Remember that everything
enclosed in curly braces in Java is considered a block.&nbsp; This code
counts the frequency of the letters in a string (in this case the
string is the alphabet which makes it easy to check for accuracy).<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>		String alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";<br>		LinkedHashMap<Character,Integer> letterMap = new LinkedHashMap<Character,Integer> (); <br>		<br>		for (int i=0; i&lt;alphabet.length(); i++) {<br>			int count;<br>			Character c = alphabet.charAt(i);<br>			if (letterMap.get(c) == null) {<br>				letterMap.put(c, 0);<br>			}<br>			count = letterMap.get(c);<br>			letterMap.put(c, count+1);<br>		}<br>		<br>		for (Character key : letterMap.keySet()) {<br>			System.out.println("letter: " + key + " count: " + letterMap.get(key));<br>		}<br><br></Character,Integer></Character,Integer></pre>
</div>

<br>

Now the same program in Groovy but, be careful, Groovy uses the curly
braces to delimit in-line closures.&nbsp; To call this out the program
iterates twice over the string with the last iterations using Closure
objects.<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>def alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"<br>def letterMap = [:]<br>// "each" method below takes a closure parameter<br>alphabet.each {<br>  letterMap.put(it, letterMap.get(it,0) + 1)  // get with two parameters has a side-effect<br>}<br>// again "each" method takes a closure parameter<br>letterMap.each { key, value -&gt; println "letter: $key count: $value" }<br><br>Closure countIt = {<br>  letterMap.put(it, letterMap.get(it,0) + 1)  // get with two parameters has a side-effect<br>} <br>Closure showCount = {<br>	key, value -&gt; println "letter: $key count: $value"<br>}<br>// similar to above but now the Closure is explicit<br>alphabet.each countIt<br>letterMap.each showCount<br></pre>
</div>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How It Works</span><br>

<br>

A closure is a code fragment that can be treated as an
object.&nbsp;&nbsp; This concept has been incorporated in programming
languages for a very long time, but was ignored by many mainstream
languages (Java alert - closures are coming in Java v. 8).&nbsp;&nbsp;
The closest thing that Java has to a closure now is an anonymous class;
however, if you've every passed a pointer function in C then you have
passed code as an object.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When to Use It</span><br>

<br>

When you program in a language with this feature you use it all of the
time.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, many Groovy programmers don't realize that
they are using a closure thinking it's a Java block.&nbsp; When you
really start thinking in Groovy you see the value of closures.&nbsp;
This will be demonstrated in Nested Closure.<br>

<br>

<hr><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nested Closure</span><br>

<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Express statement subelements of a
function call by putting them into a closure in an argument.</span><br>

<br>

Example - Simple Computer Configuration Using Nested Closures (Groovy)<br>

<br>

This is a fairly complex use of closures.&nbsp; The following Groovy
programs uses not only nested closure parameters but also other
features of Groovy like the ability to have more than one class defined
in a script (below is a Groovy script, not a Groovy class).&nbsp; I
show it in its entirety as it can (and should) be cut and pasted into a
GroovyConsole window to run.<br>

<br>

Also note that the closure parameter (as any parameter) requires a
name.&nbsp; I chose 'block' just to confuse the Java programmers out
there (not really, but Fowler calls them blocks in the text).<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre><br>class ComputerBuilder {<br>	Computer comp<br>	Processor proc<br>	<br>	def doBuild(Closure block) {<br>		block.setDelegate(this)<br>		block.call()<br>		return comp<br>	}<br>	<br>	def computer (Closure block) {<br>		block.setDelegate(this)<br>		block.call()<br>		comp = new Computer()<br>		comp.proc = proc<br>		return comp<br>	}<br>	<br>        def processor(Closure block) {<br>		proc = new Processor()		<br>		block.setDelegate(this)<br>		block.call()<br>	}	<br>	<br>	def cores(int n){<br>		proc.cores = n<br>	}<br><br>	def i386() {<br>	   proc.type = "i386"	<br>	}<br>	<br>	def speed(float s){<br>		proc.speed = s<br>	}<br>	<br>}<br><br>class Computer {<br>	Processor proc<br>	String toString() {<br>		"Computer( ${proc.toString()} )"<br>	}<br>	<br>}<br><br>class Processor {<br>	int cores<br>	String type<br>	float speed<br>	String toString(){<br>		"Processor( cores: $cores, type: $type, speed: $speed )"<br>	}<br>	<br>}<br><br>// main section of script here<br>ComputerBuilder cb = new ComputerBuilder()<br><br>def myComputer = cb.doBuild {<br>	computer<br>	  {<br>		processor { <br>			cores(2) <br>			i386()<br>			speed(2.2)<br>		}<br>	}<br>}<br><br>println myComputer<br></pre>
</div>

<br>

What's printed at the end is a representation of Fowler's Semantic
Model for a computer configuration.&nbsp; Here's the output from this
program.<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>Computer( Processor( cores: 2, type: i386, speed: 2.2 ) )<br></pre>
</div>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How It Works</span><br>

<br>

Nested closure is similar to that of Nested Function but the child
expressions of the function call are wrapped in a closure.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When To Use It</span><br>

<br>

You may need to control when the arguments of closure are evaluated and
Nested Closure gives you this.&nbsp; If your host language doesn't
provide closures (like Java) then you're out of luck.<br>

<br>

<hr><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic Reception</span><br>

<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Define methods on the fly during
run-time.</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> Aka "pretended
methods."</span><br>

<br>

Example - Generating arbitrary markup (Groovy)<br>

<br>

Some internal DSL designers think Dynamic Reception is the essence of a
DSL.&nbsp; This may not hold for all internal DSLs but the technique is
very powerful.&nbsp; Fowler points out how Dynamic Reception is used to
implement Ruby's Active Record dynamic finders.&nbsp;&nbsp; Grails has
a similar concept called "dynamic finders."<br>

<br>

Rather than belabor this topic a more interesting one is combined use
of Nested Closure and Dynamic Reception.&nbsp;&nbsp; First here is
Nested Closure used again to build a tree structure.&nbsp; (The astute
reader will notice the similarity to computer configuration previously
discussed).<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>current = null<br>def root (Closure block) {<br>	def tree = [:]<br>	def root = [:]<br>	tree["root"] = root<br>	def parent = current<br>	current = root<br>	block.call()<br>	current = parent<br>	return tree<br>}<br><br>def node (key, Closure block) {<br>	def node = [:]<br>	current[key] = node<br>	def parent = current<br>	current = node<br>	block.call()<br>	current = parent<br>}<br><br>def leaf (key, value){<br>	current[key] = value<br>}<br><br>//pseudo builder code<br>def tree = root {<br>	node("sub-tree-1") {<br>		leaf "leaf-1", "leaf-object-1"<br>	}<br>	node("sub-tree-2") {<br>		node("node-1") {<br>			leaf "leaf-1", "leaf-object-1"<br>		}<br>	}<br>}<br><br>println tree</pre>
</div>

<br>

Here is the tree that is printed at the end of the script (the tree
represents the Semantic Model). Note the liberal use of Literal Map.<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>[root:[sub-tree-1:[leaf-1:leaf-object-1], sub-tree-2:[node-1:[leaf-1:leaf-object-1]]]]<br></pre>
</div>

<br>

Now let's combine Nested Closure with Dynamic Reception to implement a
simple markup generator.&nbsp; First examine the following code snippet.<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>def builder = new PoorMansTagBuilder()<br><br>builder.root {<br>	level1 {<br>		level2{<br>		}<br>	}<br>}<br></pre>
</div>

<br>

Looks like it's calling the root method within builder passing it an
anonymous closure that itself has nested closures.&nbsp; Now lets see
the class PoorMansTagBuilder.<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>class PoorMansTagBuilder {<br>	def indent = 0<br>	def methodMissing(String name, args) {<br>		indent.times {print " "}<br>		println "&lt;${name}&gt;"<br>		indent++<br>		args[0].delegate = this // change delegate to the builder<br>		args[0].call()<br>		indent--<br>		indent.times { print " "}<br>		println "&lt;/${name}&gt;"<br>	}<br>}<br><br></pre>
</div>

<br>

Whenever Groovy encounters a "methodMissing" exception it looks for a
method the literally has that name.&nbsp; And it conveniently passes
the name of the method and a variable argument array of what the parser
considers the methods parameters.&nbsp; In this case the first missing
method is "root" and its parameter is the anonymous closure that
follows it which can be reference as "arg[0]".&nbsp; Before calling
that anonymous closure its delegate is set to "this" which means that
any nested missing method will also be caught by "methodMissing." <br>

<br>

I hope you like recursion because there's a healthy dose of it here.<br>

<br>

This is what the script prints.<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>&lt;root&gt;<br> &lt;level1&gt;<br>  &lt;level2&gt;<br>  &lt;/level2&gt;<br> &lt;/level1&gt;<br>&lt;/root&gt;</pre>
</div>

<br>

These techniques are used extensively in variously Groovy builders: MarkupBuilder, XMLBuilder, JMXBuilder, SwingBuilder.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How It Works</span><br>
<br>
Many dynamic languages react to an unknown method invocation by calling
a special error-handling method at the top of the object
hierarchy.&nbsp; You can introduce your own processing method for this
method.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">When to Use It</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>Use this when there are many similar, but slightly different,
queries to be issued.&nbsp; For example, the simplest WHERE clause of
an SQL statement varies little from query to query. <br>
<br>
Also consider its use when you have to build well-understood hierarchical structures.<br>
