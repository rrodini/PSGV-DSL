<span style="font-weight: bold;">Delimiter-Directed and Syntax-Directed
Translation</span><br>

<br>

If a DSL is a "mini-language" then Delimiter-Directed translators
process "micro-languages."&nbsp; This type of translation is so
routinized that there typically are Operating System apis or language
apis that implement them.&nbsp; From Delimiter-Directed translators
there is a very big step up to
Syntax-Directed translators.&nbsp; This step usually entails the
definition of a language grammar and possibly the use of compiler tools
like a parser generator.<br>

<br>

Let's start with the easy approach of Delimiter-Directed Translation<br>

<hr>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Delimiter-Directed Translation<br>
<br>
How It Works</span><br>

<br>

Delimiter-Directed Translation (DDT) works by taking the input and
breaking
it down into small chunks based on a small set of delimiter
characters.&nbsp; Usually the input is line-oriented so the individual
lines are isolated and then delimiter characters are used to isolate
tokens within the line.<br>

<br>

Due to the line-orientation there is a the fundamental problem of
distinguishing between a "logical line" and one or more "physical
lines".&nbsp; To solve this problem most DDTs recognize some kind of
line continuation characters
(Example: \ character in Korn shell scripts).<br>

<br>

Another characteristic here is that each line is autonomous and can be
processed independently of other lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the easiest
case for a DDL, but a sophisticated DDL can still handle
semi-autonomous lines where context is important.<br>

<br>

Once a line has been read then next step is to tokenize (break it into
tokens) based on an established set of delimiter characters (you can
consider these punctuation characters).&nbsp; During this process you
want to ignore white space characters (examples: blanks and tabs) and
comment lines.<br>

<hr><span style="font-weight: bold;">
When To Use It</span><br>

<br>

The great strength of DDT is that it is a technique that is very simple
for people to use.&nbsp; As mentioned before the next step is a big one
to Syntax-Directed Translation (SDT).<br>

<br>

There is always that danger that a simple DDT type language grows and
grows in complexity.&nbsp; This is matched by the growing complexity of
the DDT itself which may become unmaintainable.<br>

<hr>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DDT Example: Windows .ini file</span><br>

<br>

Although .ini files are obsolete they represent an example of a
micro-language processed by a DDT.&nbsp; A line can be:<br>

<ul>

  <li>A comment</li>
</ul>

<div class="code">; comment-text<br>
</div>

<ul>

  <li>A section header</li>
</ul>

<div class="code">[section]<br>
</div>

<ul>

  <li>A property definition</li>
</ul>

<div class="code">name = value<br>
</div>

<br>

Since .ini files have such a simple format there is a Windows api that
implements a DDT for them,&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724353%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><big><code>GetPrivateProfileString</code></big></a><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724353%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">.</a><br>

<hr>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DDT Example: Java properties file</span><br>

<br>

Java .properties files also exemplify a micro-language processed by a
DDT.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

A line can be:<br>

<ul>

  <li>A comment</li>
</ul>

<div class="code"># comment-text <br>
! more comment-text<br>
</div>

<ul>

  <li>A property definition</li>
</ul>

<div class="code">name = value<br>
name1 = a very \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long property \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value<br>
</div>

<br>

The class used to read and write properties files is <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html" target="_blank"><big><code>java.util.Properties</code></big></a>.&nbsp;
As of version 1.5 Java property files can be represented in XML syntax.<br>

<br>

<hr>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DDT Example -&nbsp; Frequent&nbsp;
Customer Points</span><br>

<br>

This is the example given by Fowler (pp. 205 - 210) and I believe it
pushes the limit of what can be down with a DDT.&nbsp; Each "offer" is
line-oriented and each line is autonomous.&nbsp; The processing of each
line is non-trivial.&nbsp; Note that the processing program consists of
two distinct&nbsp; sets of classes:&nbsp; those related to the semantic
model and those which implement the DDT.<br>

<br>

Here's a potential grammar for the "offers" language.<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>offer : reward-phrase activity-phrase location-phrase ;<br>reward-phrase : number per-phrase? 'for' ;<br>per-phrase : 'per' ('day' | 'dollar') ;<br>activity-phrase : ('stay' duration | 'dinner' | 'spa treatment' ) ;<br>duration : number ('night' | 'nights' ) ;<br>number : ('0'..'9')+ ;<br>location-phrase : at locaction;<br>location : ( 'Bree' | 'Dol Amroth' | ...) ('or' location)* ;<br></pre>
</div>

<br>

Fowler's next example of Miss Grant's Controller is even more complex
and should steer you toward a SDT.<br>

<br>

<hr>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Syntax-Directed Translator</span><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How it Works</span><br>

<br>

At this point your DSL is no longer a "micro language" and it needs a
grammar.&nbsp; A grammar is a set of formal rules that specify what are
legal sentences in your language.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the grammar plays a
key role is cannot be omitted.<br>

<br>

The grammar can be incorporated into the SDT in two ways.&nbsp; It can
be directly implemented via a technique known as Recursive Descent
Parser (custom program) or it can be processed by a Parser Generator
which generates a program for you.&nbsp; The result of parsing is a
syntax-tree representation of the language.&nbsp; The syntax-tree, as
we will see later, can be further processed into a form that meets the
goals of the DSL.<br>

<br>

Both approaches are shown in the diagram below.<br>

<br>

<img style="width: 457px; height: 357px;" alt="basic-parsing" src="images/basic-parsing.jpg"><br>

<img alt="basic-parsing" src="images/basic-parsing.tiff"><br>

When using a SDT you will almost always see a separation between a
lexer and a parser.&nbsp; A lexer, also called a tokenizer or a
scanner, is the first stage in processing the input text.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The tokens are generally defined using regular expressions.&nbsp; Once
a token is recognized it is processed by the parser to determine how it
fits into the syntax tree.<br>

<br>

Despite its simplicity of purpose the lexer must deal with line
continuation problems, white-space elimination, and comment
processing.&nbsp; Sometime (actually frequently) comments are
eliminated before the parser can see them.&nbsp; This is not a good
approach when your DSL represents a translator from one language form
to another and you want to see your comments preserved in the new
language.<br>

<br>

The next part of SDT is the parser itself.&nbsp; The parser's behavior
can be divided into two main sections: syntactic analysis and
actions.&nbsp; Syntactic analysis takes the stream of tokens and
arranges them into a parse tree.&nbsp; The actions take that tree and
do something with it, like populating a Semantic Model.<br>

<br>

<hr>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When to Use It</span><br>

<br>

Syntax Directed Translation used when you move beyond line-oriented
Delimiter-Directed Translation.&nbsp; It is a more sophisticated
approach requiring the definition of a grammar.<br>

<br>

A grammar has the benefit of making clear what are legal sentences and
phrases in the language.&nbsp; It provides clear documentation of the
syntactic structure of the DSL it's processing.&nbsp; This makes it
easier to evolve the syntax of the DSL over time.<br>

<br>

<hr>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SDT Example: Nested Name List</span><br>

<br>

Our SDT will parse name lists.&nbsp; What is a name list, you
ask?&nbsp; Here's one: [a, b, c].&nbsp; Here's one with a nested list: <br>

[a, [b, c], d].&nbsp; Here's that the parse tree for each of these
examples looks like.<br>

<br>

<img style="width: 581px; height: 417px;" alt="list parse tree" src="images/list-parse-tree.jpg"><br>

<br>

We need a grammar for this minute language and here it is.<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>list     : '[' elements ']' ;       // match bracketed list<br><br>elements : element (',' element)* ; // match comma-separated list<br><br>element  :  NAME | list ;           // element is name or nested list<br><br>NAME     : ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z')+ ;   // NAME is a sequence of at least 1 letter</pre>
</div>

<br>

The lexer will have to recognize the punctuation tokens of left/right
bracket, commas, and name tokens.&nbsp; It will have to skip white
space and to know when to stop as indicated by EOF in the input stream.<br>

<br>

Here is the main loop within the lexer.<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>    public Token nextToken() {<br>        while ( c!=EOF ) {<br>            switch ( c ) {<br>                case ' ': case '\t': case '\n': case '\r': WS(); continue;<br>                case ',' : consume(); return new Token(COMMA, ",");<br>                case '[' : consume(); return new Token(LBRACK, "[");<br>                case ']' : consume(); return new Token(RBRACK, "]");<br>                default:<br>                    if ( isLETTER() ) return NAME();<br>                    throw new Error("invalid character: "+c);<br>            }<br>        }<br>        return new Token(EOF_TYPE,"<eof>");<br>    }<br></eof></pre>
</div>

<br>

As you can see there is no rocket science here.&nbsp; The parser is not
much more complicated, however, recursion is involved (how did you
think that nested list was going to be processed?).&nbsp; Notice how
the parsing code calls upon the lexer to move to the next input token
when the current token matches the expected token.<br>

<br>

<div class="code">
<pre>public class ListParser extends Parser {<br>    public ListParser(Lexer input) { super(input); }<br>    <br>    /** list : '[' elements ']' ; // match bracketed list */<br>    public void list() {<br>        match(ListLexer.LBRACK); elements(); match(ListLexer.RBRACK);<br>    }<br>    /** elements : element (',' element)* ; */<br>    void elements() {<br>        element();<br>        while ( lookahead.type==ListLexer.COMMA ) {<br>            match(ListLexer.COMMA); element();<br>        }<br>    }<br>    /** element : name | list ; // element is name or nested list */<br>    void element() {<br>        if ( lookahead.type==ListLexer.NAME ) match(ListLexer.NAME);<br>        else if ( lookahead.type==ListLexer.LBRACK ) list();<br>        else throw new Error("expecting name or list; found "+lookahead);<br>    }<br>}<br></pre>
</div>

<br>

Let's see a Syntax Directed Translator in action by looking at a full
name list parser which uses recursive descent.<br>
