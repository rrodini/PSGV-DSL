<p>When
designing software, we&#8217;re always faced with many options, be it in
design methodology, programming paradigms, or using idioms in specific
implementations. We&#8217;ve been talking about designing DSLs, the virtues
of well-designed abstractions, and a multitude of options to make your
language expressive enough to your user community. Now we have to talk
about some other options that you&#8217;ll face.</p>

<p>Suppose you&#8217;ve decided
to adopt a DSL-based development approach for your project and you&#8217;ve
already identified a couple of business domain components that make
good candidates for expressive DSL design.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>How do you decide on your
DSL implementation strategy?</li><li>&nbsp;Do you want to use the host language and
model your problem as an internal DSL?</li><li>&nbsp;Or would you prefer to design an
external DSL to get to the level of expressivity that your users need?&nbsp;</li></ul>As with most problems in software engineering, there&#8217;s no universal
choice. It all depends on the set of constraints that the problem
domain presents and the set of options your solution domain offers. In
this section, let&#8217;s review some of the factors you need to consider
before jumping in to decide on the DSL implementation technique.<br><br><h3>LEARNING CURVE</h3>Maybe
you&#8217;re afraid to choose external DSLs because you think that designing
them is just as complex as designing a general-purpose programming
language. If that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re thinking, I don&#8217;t blame you. Just
having to deal with terms like syntax-directed translation, recursive
descent parsers, LALR and SLR seems to remind you of how complex the
whole thing can be.<br><br>In reality, most of the external DSLs required
in application development don&#8217;t need to be as complicated as a
full-blown programming language. Then again, some external DSLs will be
complex, and there is an associated learning curve as part of the cost
of development. The advantage is that you can customize almost
everything, including how you handle errors and exceptions, instead of
being confined within the constraints of an underlying host language.<br>
<br>This seems to favor using an internal DSL especially if you are
already familiar with a language such as Groovy, Ruby or Scala.
&nbsp;An internal DSL is really just a type of API, and you are using
facilities of a language you already know. &nbsp;With an external DSL,
you have to learn about parsers, grammars, and Parser Generators.
&nbsp;Yuch!<br><br>There is some truth to this but it is more nuanced.
&nbsp;Yes, there are new concepts to learn with Syntax-Directed
Translation and the way you drive parsers with grammars can seem like
magic. &nbsp;Hopefully, as you have seen from this class - it's not as
bad as many people fear and I hope this class has given you the
knowledge, understanding and experience to be able to objectively
recommend an external DSL as well an internal DSL.<br><br>Sadly, the
learning curve for Syntax-Directed Translation is made worse by the
poor documentation of Parser Generator tools. &nbsp;Most of the
documentation tends to be written for people doing general purpose
language development rather than DSLs. &nbsp;There is a need to do more
to make Parser Generator tools more accessible to those who want to use
them for DSL work but don't have a background in the language
community. &nbsp;ANTLR provides a great tool with excellent
documentation. &nbsp;(More on that in the next lecture)<br><br>Delimiter-Directed
Translation is much more familiar and an easy way to get the project
going because most of the tactics - breaking up strings, regular
expressions, and no need for grammars - are familiar to most
programmers and development managers. &nbsp;An extension of
Delimiter-Directed Translation is using an XML carrier syntax which is
already over used. &nbsp;If you find yourself in a meeting arguing
about this topic you may want to seriously consider diving into the
Syntax-Directed Translation curve because most likely your grammar will
be simpler and easier to read.<br><br>Lastly, internal DSLs are NOT
necessarily as easy as you might think. &nbsp;First, you have to be
familiar with the language of the internal DSL and everyone who may
work with you or maintain this code must be familiar with it as well.
&nbsp;That presents a learning curve, possibly a large learning curve.
&nbsp;Internal DSLs often rely on obscure tricks in the host language
to produce something that's fluent. &nbsp;So, even if you know the
language well, you may need to spend some time finding out about the
tricks available to you in your particular language. &nbsp;The
difference between this learning curve and the Syntax-Directed
Translation learning curve is that you can get up and running with the
internal DSL language and learn along the way but with Syntax-Directed
Translation you need to do some serious learning before you begin to
write.<br><br>So from the learning curve perspective, internal DSL probably wins but not by a great deal.<br><br><h3>COST OF BUILDING</h3>Most
of the cost of building a DSL is in the learning curve.
&nbsp;Hopefully, this class has helped lower that cost. &nbsp;It is
important to separate the cost of building the model from the cost of
building the DSL that layers over the model. &nbsp;Usually, the model
has its own justification and may already be started in some form of
API or library. &nbsp;If that is the case then layering the DSL code
over top is the future cost of creating the DSL but don't forget that
the model may need to be extended.<br><br>With an internal DSL, the
extra effort involved is in creating a layer of Expression Builders
over the model. &nbsp;The expression builders are relatively
straight-forward to write, but most effort isn't in getting them to
work but in fiddling with the language so that you have something that
works well. &nbsp;This expression builder cost won't appear if you are
putting the fluent methods directly in the model, but that may lead to
other costs if people find these methods confusing compared to a
command-query API.<br><br>With an external DSL, the equivalent cost is
building the parser. &nbsp;Once you are up to speed with
Syntax-Directed Translation, it's actually quite quick to write a
grammar and the translation code. &nbsp;It varies with implementation
but you will probably find that the cost to build a set of expression
builder routines for an internal DSL versus building a parser for an
external DSL are comparable.<br><br>Once you are familiar with
Syntax-Directed Translation, it is not that much harder than using an
XML carrier syntax, and it is easier than using Delimiter-Directed
Translation unless the language is quite simple.<br><br>Fowler finds
that once you are familiar with the techniques, there is no big
difference in cost for building an internal or external DSL.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><h3>COMMUNICATION WITH DOMAIN EXPERTS</h3>Internal
DSLs are always tied to the syntax of the host language. &nbsp;The
result will almost always be some constraints on how you can express
things, together with some amount of syntactic noise. &nbsp;While this
is unlikely to be a big factor for programmer users (who are used to
these elements), domain experts are a different matter. &nbsp;The
degree of constraints and syntactic noise also depends on the language;
some languages are better suited for DSLs than others.<br><br>Even the
best internal DSLs do not offer the same syntactic flexibility as an
external DSL. &nbsp;The size of the comfort gap will depend on
particular domain experts, but such is the value of the communication
channel that I'd be inclined to push that bit harder and use an
external DSL if it looks like it could make the difference.<br><br>If
you are more comfortable building an internal DSL, you can always start
with an internal DSL and test out it's usefulness with the domain
experts. &nbsp;If it doesn't work out, all your work is not lost as the
semantic model is still relevant and now you can switch to an external
DSL.<h3>PROGRAMMER FAMILIARITY</h3>Many
people argue that with an internal DSL, programmers who use it are
using the language they are already familiar with, which makes it
easier to work with than a new, external DSL. &nbsp;To some extent this
is true, but I don't think the difference is as marked as most people
think. &nbsp;The odd fluent interface style takes as least a little to
get used to, although rather less than it does to learn how to build
it. &nbsp;An external DSL is also not hard to learn as it is, by
definition, rather simple. &nbsp;Echoing the syntactic conventions of
your usual programming language can help make it more approachable.<br><br>Other
than the syntactic element, the biggest difference is often that of the
tools. &nbsp;If your host language is one with a sophisticated IDE,
then you get to keep that familiar tooling with an internal DSL.
&nbsp;You may need to use a more complicated techniques to preserve
that tool's support, but this way you can keep enjoying the IDE's
strengths. &nbsp;With external DSLs, however, you are unlikely to be
offered anything but the most basic level of editing support.
&nbsp;You'll usually have to fall back to a regular text editor.
&nbsp;It's not too difficult to support syntax highlighting, and most
text editors are very configurable but thinks like type-aware
autocompletion are almost certainly out of the question. 

<h3>REUSING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>

<p>Internal
DSLs piggyback on the host language infrastructure, syntax, semantics,
module system, type system, method of error reporting, and the complete
tool chain that it integrates with. This piggybacking is possibly the
most definitive advantage of implementing internal DSLs. For external
DSLs, you need to build all these from the ground up, which is never an
easy proposition. Even within internal DSLs, you have lots of
implementation patterns to choose from, as we saw in the last section.
Your choice here will mostly depend on the capabilities of your host
language and the level of abstraction that it supports.</p><p>A
benefit of this thin boundary is that is allows you to use the host
language freely when you don't have the constructs of the internal DSL
available to you. &nbsp;So, if you need to express arithmetic in your
DSL, there is no point in making DSL constructs for this; just use the
feathers of the host language. &nbsp;If you need to build abstractions
on top of the DSL, you can use the abstraction layer of the host
language.</p>

<p>If you
use a language like Scala or Haskell that offers rich type systems, you
can decide to use them to encode your domain types and have a purely
embedded DSL. But embedding might not always be the most appropriate
option available. The language that you&#8217;re trying to embed needs to
have concrete syntax and semantics similar to that of the host language
for embedding to work. A mismatch in either will make your DSL look
foreign to the ecosystem of the host language and will never compose
with its native control structures. In such cases, you might want to
resort to metaprogramming techniques, if they&#8217;re offered by your host
language. <br>
</p><p>This
strength is particularly nice when you need to put chunks of imperative
code inside you DSL. &nbsp;A good example of this is using a DSL to
describe how to build software. &nbsp;We have looked at the build
languages that use a dependency network, such as external DSLs Make and
Ant as well as an internal DSL Gradle. &nbsp;All of these are good at
expressing dependency network that you need for builds. &nbsp;However,
the content of many build tasks requires more complex logic, and often
the dependencies themselves need abstractions layered on top of them.
&nbsp;Ant has suffered from sliding into generality, acquiring all
manner of imperative constructs that don't suit its nature or syntax.</p><p>Contrast
this with Gradle where you are free to mix your dependency network with
imperative code in nested closures and you have scripts that make it
easier to describe complicated build actions. &nbsp;Using Groovy's
objects and methods to build abstractions on top of the dependency
network helps describe the higher-level structure of the build.</p><p>It
is not impossible to mix external DSLs with host code and this is what
we normally see when we mix in regular expressions or SQL code today.
&nbsp;However, the mixing is awkward and usually looks like an
exceptional statement and not part of the script. &nbsp;Tools usually
do not know what you are doing and thus it looks clunky. &nbsp;If you
want to intermix host and DSL code, then an internal DSL is almost
always the way to go.<br>
</p>

<h3>LEVERAGING EXISTING KNOWLEDGE</h3>

<p>There
are situations when your decision to use an implementation paradigm is
driven by the available knowledge base of your team members. Internal
DSLs are more likely to score on this point. The important point to
consider is that being familiar with the language doesn&#8217;t imply that
the programmers are aware of the DSL-friendly idioms that it offers.
Fluent interfaces are commonly used in Java and Ruby, but they have
their pitfalls too. All these
things involve subtle idiomatic usage of the language, which
contributes to the consistency of your DSL.</p>

<p>Leveraging existing
knowledge is certainly an important consideration. As the leader of the
team, judge the expertise of your team members, based on the context of
DSL implementation, not on their familiarity of the surface syntax of
the language. I&#8217;ve seen instances when a team decided to use XML as the
external DSL and gained a lot in productivity and user acceptance
instead of trying to shoehorn internal DSLs into Java.<br>
<br>
</p><h3>THE RIGHT LEVEL OF EXPRESSIVITY</h3>

<p>Although
internal DSLs score a lot of points by reusing existing infrastructure,
it&#8217;s also true that the constraints that the base language forces on
you can make it difficult to achieve the right level of expressivity
for your domain users. More often than not, modules are identified as
candidates for DSL long after the development environment and the tool
chain have been finalized. It&#8217;s not always possible to switch to an
alternate language that might have been a better candidate for the DSL
design.</p><p>The
ability to freely mix host and DSL code isn't always a positive.
&nbsp;It only works if the users of the DSL are comfortable with the
host language. &nbsp;Throwing lumps of a host language into the DSL
will usually only raise a communication barrier that the DSL was
supposed to avoid.</p>

<p>When this happens, you need to consider external DSLs as
part of your application infrastructure. The main advantage of modeling
a problem with an external DSL is that you can design it precisely to
the level of sophistication that you need for the problem at hand. It
also gives you ample room for tweaking, based on user feedback. This
isn&#8217;t always possible with internal DSLs, because you have to abide by
the basic constraints of syntax and semantics that the base language
enforces.</p><p>One
of the benefits of a DSL is that is produces a restricted range of what
can be done. &nbsp;This restriction can make it easier to understand
what to do, and serves as a barrier to bugs. &nbsp;If you have a DSL
with strong boundaries, that limits the kinds of things you need to
test for. &nbsp;
<br>
</p>

<h3>COMPOSABILITY</h3>

<p>In a typical application
development scenario, you need to compose DSLs with each other and also
with the host language. Composing internal DSLs with the host language
is easy. After all, the DSL uses the same language and is mostly
implemented as a library that embeds into your host language.</p>

<p>But
let&#8217;s talk a bit about combining multiple DSLs, even when they&#8217;re
implemented using the same host language. If you&#8217;re using statically
typed languages for implementation and you&#8217;ve designed embedded DSLs,
you need the support of the host language&#8217;s type system to ensure
seamless composability between them. Languages that support functional
programming paradigms encourage you to design internal DSLs based on
functional combinators. The internal DSL and the combinators can be
completely composable, if they&#8217;re designed properly. External DSLs are
harder to design in this manner, particularly if they were designed
separately and without considering composability as an upfront
criterion.</p><h3>RUNTIME CONFIGURATION</h3>One
of the main reasons that XML DSLs have become so popular is that they
allow you to alter the execution context of the code from compile time
to runtime. &nbsp;For situations where you are using a compiled
language and want to alter the behavior of the system without
recompiling, this is an important factor. &nbsp;External DSLs allow
you to do this since you can easily parse them at runtime, translate
into a semantic model, and then execute that model.<br><br>One approach
is to use interpreted languages in conjunction with a compiled
language. &nbsp;You can then write an internal DSL in the interpreted
language. &nbsp;In this scenario, many of the common benefits of an
internal DSL may be attenuated. &nbsp;Unless most of the team is
familiar with the dynamic language, you won't get the the language
familiarity benefit of internal DSLs.<br><br><h3>SLIDING INTO GENERALITY</h3>We
have talked about Ant since the first night of class and Ant is one of
the most successful DSLs around. &nbsp;Ant is a language for specifying
builds for Java; it is an external DSL in XML syntax.<br><br>Ant is
both a roaring success and a nightmare! &nbsp;It filled a huge gap in
Java development at the time, but since then, its success has forced
many teams to face its flaws. &nbsp;There are many problems with Ant,
its XML syntax is perhaps the most noticeable. &nbsp;The real issue
behind Ant is that over time, it steadily grew in capability so that it
no longer has the limited expressiveness that a DSL needs.<br><br>This
is a common problem and can be seen throughout many useful and common
programming DSLs because programmers know how to extend these DSL and
do so for their own reasons only to make the DSL more general and
watered down. &nbsp;It happens because the demands placed on the DSL
get steadily greater, leading to more features and greater complexity -
and drop by drop, all the clarity that a good DSL has leaks out.<br><br>This
danger always exists with external DSLs - and, like most issues in
design, has no simple answer. &nbsp;It needs constant attention and
determination to not let things get too complex. &nbsp;This is always
the struggle between laws and liberty. &nbsp;Many great languages,
tools, designs and architectures start out under the firm guidance of a
strong mind and will. &nbsp;Eventually, that person moves on and their
creation falls to a committee or someone not as respected and the
original intent is watered down. &nbsp;DSLs need constant attention and
determination to not let things get too complex.<br><br>There are
alternatives. &nbsp;One is to let other languages develop for more
complicated cases. &nbsp;Instead of extending one language, you can
introduce other languages for particular and difficult cases. &nbsp;You
can layer another language over the base DSL whose output is that base
DSL. &nbsp;This can be a useful technique to allow abstractions to be
built in a language that lacks abstraction building features.
&nbsp;Internal DSLs are often a good choice when this kind of
complexity grows, because they allow you to mix DSL and general-purpose
elements.<br><br>Since internal DSLs are melded in with a
general-purpose host language, they don't suffer from this problem.
&nbsp;An analogous problem may arise when mixing with the host language
gets so intertwined that you lose the DSLness of the internal DSL....
